# source_validator (OBS source service) 

This is an [Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org/) source service.
This service acts as a pre-filter to find common pitfalls in package sources
for SUSE/SLE/openSUSE distributions before build or submit requests are created.
It will also help human manual source peer-review.

As with any OBS source service, this plugin can be used via project wide
defined services.

This is the git repository for
[openSUSE:Tools/obs-service-source_validator](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Tools/obs-service-source_validator).
